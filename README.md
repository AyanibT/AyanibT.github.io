I am a Civil Engineer with a Master’s degree in Water Engineering and Management from the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand, and a strong interest in renewable energy, geospatial analysis, and climate-focused infrastructure development. My professional journey began in 2014 when I joined Khwopa Engineering College, Nepal, and since earning my Bachelor's degree in 2019, I have worked across diverse roles in hydropower, solar energy, GIS, and technical consulting.

I started my career at M.S. Tech Pvt. Ltd., a consultancy focused on hydropower and geotechnical projects. During my time there, I contributed to feasibility studies, technical reports, GIS mapping, and design tasks for projects such as the Hongu Khola HPP, Simbuwa Khola HPP, and Dharamnagar Solar Farm.

Alongside this, I was involved with Science Playground Pvt. Ltd., an educational initiative by the same founder, where I worked on developing interactive science exhibits. A highlight of this collaboration was leading the "3D Terrain Modeling of Nepal" project—an innovative 3D printed map integrating topography, hydrology, and infrastructure for educational and planning purposes.

Later, as an independent consultant, I developed a GIS database and published an interactive web map showcasing all listed hydropower and solar projects in Nepal at various development stages. This work contributed to broader technical studies for Nepal’s power system planning in the context of the Dudhkoshi Storage HEP and beyond.

I am currently working as a Project Engineer, providing technical support in hydropower project execution. My responsibilities include coordinating contracts based on FIDIC standards, reviewing bid / contract documents for Civil, Hydro-mechanical and Electro-mechanical works, and overseeing site supervision and reporting for projects such as Upper Pikhuwa (4.9 MW) and Pikhuwa Pashupati (4.1 MW).

I am passionate about leveraging GIS, WebGIS, data analysis, and open-source tools to support sustainable energy infrastructure and climate-resilient development.
